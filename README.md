# Retrieval-Augmented Auto Citation Suggestion (RACS)

**Enhancing Academic Writing through Context-Aware Reference Selection**

## Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Auto Citation Suggestion (RACS)** is a citation recommendation system designed to assist researchers and writers in accurately citing relevant prior work. By combining large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), RACS improves citation reliability in academic writing by leveraging contextual document retrieval.

## Motivation

Citing appropriate references is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Existing LLMs often hallucinate or suggest irrelevant or non-existent papers. This project addresses that problem by integrating retrieval into the generation process, increasing both the relevance and accuracy of citations.

## Key Features

- Context-aware citation suggestion using RAG  
- Reference repository integration for precise retrieval  
- Reduced hallucinations compared to vanilla LLM prompting  
- Scalable and modular architecture for extension to various academic fields
